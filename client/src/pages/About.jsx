                Hello everybody! We are the Remote Rangers, the group that built this website. Our goal is to provide a job search website specifically for people looking to work remote/from home. With our job searching application users and employers can create accounts to post/search for remote postions available. We have pulled in Google's job search API tool to help search for jobs from employers who are not on 'Remote Pathfinder.' This way users have the most opportunities presented to them. If you have any questions please visit our contact page!
